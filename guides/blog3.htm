      <p>With Adobe ending its Flash support on modern browsers back in late 2020, you may want to try your old favorite Flash games for fun or a nostalgia fest. Here in this guide, I will show you how to achieve that!</p>

      <p>We will be using <b>Flashpoint Archive (formerly known as BlueMaxima's Flashpoint)</b>, a community-driven open-source project that aims to archive all Flash games & animations.</p>

      <!-- Section 1 -->
      <div id="section1">
        <h2>Installation</h2>
        <p>First, you will need to head to <a href="https://flashpointarchive.org" target="_blank">BlueMaxima's Flashpoint</a>, then click on <b>Download</b>. It will then ask which version you wish to download. If you are having trouble choosing one, hereâ€™s the difference:</p>
        <p><b>Flashpoint 12 Infinity</b> is for casual users who want to just experience a few games or are tight on disk space. You can freely download games whenever you want to play, even offline.</p>
        <p><b>Flashpoint 12 Ultimate</b> is for people who just want to keep all games for some reason; games are already preinstalled from the get-go.</p>
        <p>Once you have downloaded the version you want, start up the setup, click on <b>Install Flashpoint</b>, and let it do its thing.</p>
