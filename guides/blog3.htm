    <p>With Adobe ending it's Flash's support on Modern Browsers back in late 2020, you may want to try your old favorite Flash games for fun or nostalgia fest. Here in this guide I will show you how to achieve that!</p>

    <p>We will be using <b>Flashpoint Archive (formerly known as BlueMaxima's Flashpoint)</b>, it is a community driven open source project that aims to archive all Flash Games & Animations.</p>
    <!-- Section 1 -->
    <h2 id="section1">Installation</h2>
    <p>First you will need to head to <a href="https://flashpointarchive.org" target="_blank">BlueMaxima's Flashpoint</a>, then click on <b>Download</b>. It will then ask which version you wish to download, if you are having trouble choosing one, heres the difference.</p>
    <p><b>Flashpoint 12 Infinity</b> is for casual people who want to just experience few games or tight on Disk-Space, you can freely download games whenever you want to play, even play offline.</p>
    <p><b>Flashpoint 12 Ultimate</b> is for people who just wanna keep all games for some reason, games are already preinstalled from the get-go.</p>
    <p>Once you have downloaded the version you want, Start up the Setup, click on <b>Install Flashpoint</b></p> and let it do its thing.</p>
