    <p>Computers slow down over time which is completely normal, after years of constant use. However you can speed up your computer easily by following these simple & quick tricks!</p>

    <!-- Section 1 -->
    <h2 id="section1"><b>Why do our computers slow down?</b></h2>
    <p>There are many factors as to why our computers slowdown overtime, like outdated versions, outdated hardware, bloatware and even viruses could be the culprit.</p>
    <p>Well without further ado, let's go over these ez tricks on boosting your computer's speed!</p>
   

    <h2 id="section2">Stop Heavy Programs</h2>
    <p>You can close programs which you don't use manually, alternativly you could use the <b>Task Manager</b> which shows detailed info on which program is using the most of your CPU,GPU,RAM,Memory & Power usage (laptops). You can either right click on the Taskbar then click on Task Manager or you can use the shortcut <b>Ctrl + Shift + Esc</b>.</p>
    
    <p>From there select the program/application that's taking the most resources or and click on <b>End Task</b>.</p>

    <p>Alternatively right click on the program then click <b>End Task</b></p>
    <img id="zoomable-image" src="C:\Users\blusk\Desktop\Test Website\guidesimgs\blog2\TaskManagerTask2.png" alt="Alternative way in Task Manager" height="485">

    <h2 id="section3">Optimize Startup programs</h2>
    <p>You can optimize startup programs on your computer so it boots up faster so open up your Task Manager then head to Startup and click on the application that's not important to you and click on <b>disable</b>, Alternativly you can <b>right click > disable</b></p>

    <h2 id="section4">Remove Unwanted Programs</h2>
    <p>You can remove uneeded programs by either hitting the windows key and searching <b>"Add or Remove Programs"</b>, there you can sort it by Name, Size & Install date. You can also filter which drive you want to delete programs from, now click on the program/application you want delete, click <b>Uninstall</b>. You can also move & modify the program/application if available.</p>

    <p>Alternatively you can use the Control Panel's Uninstall a program, there you can sort by Name, Publisher, Installed On, Size & Version, select the program you wanna uninstall then <b>click uninstall</b> either on top or right click and <b>click on unistall in the popup menu</b>.</p>

    <h2 id="section5">Remove Bloatware</h2>
    <p>Bloatware are unwanted preinstalled junks on computers. They take up free space & resources, you can either do it manually or use a Bloatware Remover.</p>
    <p>If you can plan on using a Bloatware Remover then I'd recommand using the Windows 10 Debloater by Sycnex from github, Download <a href="https://github.com/Sycnex/Windows10Debloater" target="_blank">here</a></p>
    <p>The only thing you'll need is Powershell which if its not installed, you can get it <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/" target="_blank">here</a>. Extract the file once downloaded, then select the GUI one <b>"Windows10DebloaterGUI"</b>. Open it with Poweshell (if it just opens up with notepad, right on the gui file and open with Poweshell) and once its loaded up, click <b>Remove All Bloatware</b> and it should do the rest automatically.</p>

    <h2 id="section6">Change your broswer</h2>
    <p>Change your broswer to something that's light on CPU & RAM, most of us are using chrome but we don't realize that chrome takes way too much RAM & our CPU usage.</p>
    <p>Here are some alternatives to Chrome, if you wish to check them out - <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/" target="_blank">FireFox</a> | <a href="https://www.opera.com/gx/gx-browser" target="_blank">OperaGX</a> | <a href="https://sourceforge.net/software/product/Pale-Moon/" target="_blank">Pale Moon</a> | <a href="https://brave.com" target="_blank">Brave</a> etc.. consume less resources than chrome

    <h2 id="section7">Purge unused Extensions!</h2>
    <p>You should disable any unused extensions you have on any of your broswers as they take away resources, (I'll be using Chrome for this but it should be similar to other broswers too) you can head to the extension tab by either a shortcut or click on the 3 dots on the top right of your screen then to Extensions > Manage Extensions.</p>
    <img id="zoomable-image" src="C:\Users\blusk\Desktop\Test Website\guidesimgs\blog2\Extensions route chrome.PNG" alt="Chrome Extension" height="485">
    <p>If you have any extension previously installed, you should see them, now just toggle them off.</p>

    <h2 id="section8">Change Battery Settings</h2>
    This is only for laptops, they reserve some of their performance to save battery, escpiaclly when laptops aren't plugged in with a charger. 
    <img id="zoomable-image" src="C:\Users\blusk\Desktop\Test Website\guidesimgs\blog2\Battery_Icon.PNG" alt="Battery Icon at System Tray" height="485">
    <p>For this one simple setting I'd highly recommend to plug in with an actuve charger, first click on the Battery Icon on the system tray then move the slider to Best Performance.</p>
    
    <h2 id="section9">Upgrade your hardware</h2>
    <p>If unfortunately none of these work out, then it might be the time to upgrade your hardware as it could be outdated and unable to keep up with modern technologies.</p>
    <p>+ <b>Upgrade RAM to handle multiple applications, in short makes your computer alot faster.</b></p>
    <p>+ <b>Upgrade GPU for faster performance interms of Gaming or Video Processing</b></p>
    <p>+ <b>Upgrade to an SSD card for less load times</b></p>
